#  Common Errors and how to handle Them
The error "please complete authentication in your browser" occurs because GitHub requires authentication to allow the push command. Here's how students can fix this issue:

# Solution 1: Authenticate Using a Personal Access Token (PAT)

GitHub has replaced password authentication with Personal Access Tokens (PAT) for better security.

## 1. Generate a Personal Access Token:
- Go to your GitHub profile, click on Settings.
- Navigate to Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens → Tokens (classic) → Generate New Token.
- Select scopes (check repo and write:packages for access).
- Generate the token and copy it.

## 2. Replace Password with the Token:
- When prompted for your GitHub credentials during git push, use the token as the password.

# Solution 2: Use SSH Keys for Authentication
## 1. Generate an SSH Key:

Open a terminal and type:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
- Press Enter to save the key to the default location.
- Optionally, add a passphrase.
  ## 2.  Add the SSH Key to Your GitHub Account:
Copy the key to your clipboard:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | xclip -sel clip
```
- Go to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH Key.
- Paste the key and save.

## 3. Update Your Git Remote URL to Use SSH:
Replace the HTTPS URL with the SSH URL:
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<username>/<repository>.git
```
## 4. Push Again:
Now try running:
```bash
git push origin main
```
# Solution 3: Use GitHub CLI
1. Install GitHub CLI:
- Install GitHub CLI by following the instructions for your OS: GitHub CLI Installation.
2. Authenticate with GitHub:
- Run the following command to log in:
```bash
git push origin main
```
- Follow the instructions to authenticate via the browser.
 3. Push Changes:
Retry the git push origin main command.
